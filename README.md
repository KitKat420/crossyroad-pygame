## History

Crossy Road is an arcade video game released on 20 November 2014. It was developed and published by Hipster Whale, with the name and concept of the game playing on the age old joke "Why did the chicken cross the road?" The game has been described as "endless Frogger".

## crossyroad-pygame functionality 

My version of Crossy Road uses the library, Pygame, that allowed me to implement key controls; an automated car system and paddle; a scoring system and a win condition. I also went a bit further and used the open method to persist highscores.
